# Maven Java CLI Game Template

### Description:
This project provides a template for building a CLI game in Java using Maven

### Local Usage:
1. Build the game jar with ` mvn clean package `
2. Run the game using the local script ` ./run.sh `

### Details:
Currently a stub for the game "2048" is implemented, but any cli game could be developed instead.
The basic rendering / user interface and board management is implemented, but the actual game logic has not.
(This is easy to do, the current template is to demonstrate how such a cli game could be managed.)
